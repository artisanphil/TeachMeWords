The app was made using Ionic. It is written in Angular and uses the <a href="https://github.com/hhzl/LearnWords2">LearnWords</a> Javascript-Library.

There is an issue with newer Cordova API's not being able to find directories on the SD card, therefore we are targeting API 22.

Contribution is welcome.
