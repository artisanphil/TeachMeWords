### Practice Mode

In practice mode you will hear a word (or letter) and then you need to choose from one of 4 options. It won't continue to the next word until you have made the correct selection. After you have gone through all words in the lesson, the wrong answered words will be questioned again.

### Review Mode

The review mode is optional (and currently slightly hidden). You can find it by clicking on the hamburger menu on the lesson overview page. In the review mode you get to practice all lessons you have already gone through. It will start with the questions you answered wrong. The words don't show up until the next day. This uses spaced-repetition, so it will ask words you already know less often.
